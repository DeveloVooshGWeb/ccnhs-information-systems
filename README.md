# Calasiao Comprehensive National High School Information Systems Project 2019
This was a project I created when I was 12 years old as a mandatory requirement for my TLE (Technology and Livelihood Education) grade in the entire class year. It contains a HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/MySQL project with a working registration, security, database, avatar, and admin system.
